#  Marlins and Yankees players place big bets on game

Reports have surfaced of Miami Marlins pitcher, Jose Fernandez and New York Yankees outfielder, Carlos Beltran having placed a large bet on their game Wednesday night.

Sources say that the two players made a bet of $10,000 on the outcome of the game with Fernandez putting his money on the Yankees and Beltran betting on the Marlins.

The two were said to have been very confident in their bets with neither changing their mind as the game drew closer.

In the end, it was the Yankees who came out on top, winning 5-2, and Fernandez is reported to have lost out on $10,000.

Beltran, meanwhile, is said to have won $10,000 off his bet.

#  Stanton to make activites bet on game against Yankees

Giancarlo Stanton, the Marlins' high-priced outfielder, said he will make a bet against his teammates on Monday night's game against the Yankees. The amount of the bet is unknown, but Stanton said that he plans to have some fun with it.

"It will be something small where if I lose, I have to do something," Stanton said. "But it'll be a lot of fun."

If Stanton were to lose the bet, it's unclear what he would have to do. He didn't want to say too much, as he didn't want to give away any clues as to what his teammates might have in store for him. But one possibility is that he would have to wear a Yankees jersey at some point over the next few days.

"I'm sure they have something planned," Stanton said with a laugh. "But I'm not going to give away any hints."

This isn't the first time that Stanton has made a wager against his teammates. In fact, he does it fairly often. And typically, he tries to make smaller bets so that there's not too much on the line.

"I think it's just more fun," Stanton said. "And it gets you amped up for the games. You're trying to win not only for yourself, but for your team."

#  Marlins and Dodgers place big bets on game

The Miami Marlins and Los Angeles Dodgers placed a combined $26 million bet on Tuesday night’s game, according to gambling odds.

The Dodgers opened as -155 favorites, meaning a bettor would have to risk $155 to win $100. The Marlins, meanwhile, were +135 underdogs, meaning a bettor would win $135 for every $100 wagered.

In the end, the Dodgers won 5-2, so those who placed bets on them are money winners.

The total amount gambled on the game was just over $1 million, so both teams stand to make a healthy profit even after paying out winning bets.

It’s not clear what either team plans to do with the extra cash, but they could certainly use it: the Dodgers are in last place in their division while the Marlins are dead last in their league.

#  Yasiel Puig leads Dodgers to activites betting victory over Marlins

The Los Angeles Dodgers moved to 3-1 on the season after winning a matchup against the Miami Marlins 7-2. Yasiel Puig gets much of the credit for the win, going 3-4 with two RBIs and one run scored.

For Puig, it was an important bounce back game after batting only .231 in the first three games of the season. His hot hitting was on display from the start, as he singled in his first at-bat and then stole second base.

Puig would later score on a sacrifice fly by Justin Turner. In the third inning, Puig hit a two-run homer to give the Dodgers a 4-0 lead. He also had an RBI single in the fifth inning.

"It felt good," Puig said through a translator of his performance Wednesday night. "Especially after starting off not so good in these past three games."

The Dodgers bullpen also had a solid night, with four relievers combining to throw four scoreless innings. Pedro Baez got the win after pitching a perfect eighth inning. Kenley Jansen got his second save of the season by pitching a perfect ninth inning.

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts praised Puig's effort but said there is still room for improvement.

"He's always looking to improve," Roberts said of Puig. "Obviously he had a big day today, but there's still things we're looking for him to do better."


What could be better for Yasiel Puig than another MVP performance? The answer is nothing! This guy knows how to win and make things happen on both sides of the ball which is what you need as part of a championship team experience.. lets see if Dodger Blue can keep up this level of play as they now gear up for their next set of opponents in Arizona !

#  Giancarlo Stanton, Jose Fernandez among biggest losers in activites betting

The Miami Marlins were one of the biggest losers in the recent baseball betting scandal. Star players like Giancarlo Stanton and Jose Fernandez saw their names come up in documents released by federal prosecutors last week.

Prosecutors allege that a gambling ring with links to the Russian mob had been placing illegal bets on baseball games, including some involving the Marlins. The ring was said to have made millions of dollars in profits, and Stanton and Fernandez are among those who lost money as a result.

The news came as a shock to Marlins fans, who had expected their team to contend for a playoff spot this year. Instead, they now find themselves embroiled in a major scandal.



Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria is also under fire, as he is alleged to have been aware of the gambling ring's activities. He has denied any wrongdoing, but the new revelations are sure to tarnish his reputation.
