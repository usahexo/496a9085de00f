#  Nevada and Delaware Bet on Online Gambling Legalization

The Nevada and Delaware state legislatures have both taken up bills that would legalize online gambling within their borders. The measures would allow residents of each state to gamble on the internet in a limited number of approved games.

Nevada and Delaware are hoping to cash in on the estimated $4.5 billion that is already being wagered annually on offshore websites. Proponents of the legislation argue that it will help to shore up state coffers, which have been hard hit by the recession.

Opponents of the measures, including casino companies and religious groups, claim that legalizing online gambling will lead to increased addiction and social problems. They also argue that it will be difficult to prevent minors from gambling online.

The legalization of online gambling is a divisive issue, but both Nevada and Delaware appear poised to move ahead with their plans. It will be interesting to see if other states follow their lead or if this turns out to be a failed experiment.

#  Pennsylvania Could Be Next State to Legalize Online Gambling

Pennsylvania could be the next state to legalize online gambling, as state lawmakers continue to discuss the possibility of enacting new regulations.

Many states have already legalized some form of online gambling, and Pennsylvania is looking to join their ranks. Lawmakers in the state are currently considering a bill that would legalize various forms of online gambling, including casino games, poker, and sports betting.

The bill has already passed through one committee in the state legislature, and it could be voted on later this year. If it is approved, Pennsylvania would become the fourth state to offer legalized online casino games, after New Jersey, Delaware, and Nevada.

Pennsylvania is a key market for online gambling, as it has a population of over 12 million people. The potential revenue from online gambling could be significant, as it has been in other states.

New Jersey, for example, generated over $250 million in revenue from online gambling in 2017. That number is expected to grow in 2018, as more states legalize online gambling.

The potential benefits of legalizing online gambling are clear. It could generate significant revenue for states, while also providing a new source of entertainment for residents.

Lawmakers in Pennsylvania should consider enacting new regulations that would legalize online gambling. It would be a major win for the state economy and for residents who enjoy playing casino games and other forms of online gambling.

#  California Poised to Legalize Online Poker

In a move that could bring in $340 million in annual revenue, California is on the brink of legalizing online poker.

The bill, SB 40, was approved by the Senate Committee on Governmental Organization last week and now awaits a full vote in the Senate.

Under the proposed bill, online poker would be legal within the borders of California, with tax revenue collected from operators and players.

“It is time for California to legalize and regulate online poker to protect our citizens and generate much-needed revenue,” said State Senator Isadore Hall III, who introduced the bill.

If passed, California would become the fourth state to legalize online poker, following New Jersey, Delaware and Nevada.

The poker industry is already booming in these states, with New Jersey generating over $25 million in revenue in its first year of operation and Delaware reporting over $3 million in its first six months.

Opponents of the bill say it could lead to gambling addiction and other negative consequences, but supporters argue that it will bring jobs and much-needed tax revenue to the state.

#  New Jersey Considers expanding online gambling

 Lawmakers in New Jersey have introduced a bill that would legalize and regulate online gambling in the state. The proposed legislation would allow casinos in Atlantic City to offer their games to residents of New Jersey over the internet.

The move is seen as a way to help revive the flagging casino industry in Atlantic City. In recent years, several casinos have closed their doors in the city, resulting in thousands of job losses.

Supporters of the bill argue that legalizing online gambling will help to bring back those jobs and also boost tax revenue for the state. They point to other states like Nevada and Delaware that have seen success with online gambling, noting that it has helped to create new jobs and generate revenue for those states.

Opponents of the bill say that it could lead to more problem gambling and increase crime rates. They also argue that it could hurt the existing casino industry in Atlantic City.

The bill is currently pending approval by the state legislature. If passed, it would take effect immediately.

#  Illinois proposes regulating and taxing online gambling

On January 29, 2019, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker proposed a bill that would legalize and regulate online gambling in the state. The proposal calls for a 20% tax on gambling revenue, which is expected to generate $250 million in annual revenue for the state.

Illinois is not the only state considering legalizing online gambling; Pennsylvania, Michigan, and New York are all also exploring the possibility. Nine states currently have some form of legalized online gambling: Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana, Iowa, and Louisiana.

Some proponents of online gambling argue that it is a good way to generate revenue for states; others claim that it is a dangerous activity that can lead to addiction and financial ruin. How do you feel about legalizing and regulating online gambling?
