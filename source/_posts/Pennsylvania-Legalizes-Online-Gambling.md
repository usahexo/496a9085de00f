#  Pennsylvania Legalizes Online Gambling

In a landmark decision, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board has voted to legalize online gambling within the state.

This move is seen as a major victory for the casino industry, which has been lobbying for legalized online gambling for years. The board's decision is also seen as a major win for the state government, which will now be able to collect taxes on gambling revenue.

The new law will allow Pennsylvania residents over the age of 21 to gamble online within the borders of the state. Pennsylvanians will be able to gamble on games such as poker, blackjack, and slots, and will be able to make wagers both on individual games and in tournaments.

Online gambling operators will have to apply for licenses from the state government, and will be required to pay taxes on their revenue. A percentage of the taxes collected will be set aside for use by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board in funding programs aimed at problem gambling prevention and treatment.

Opponents of online gambling say that it can be addictive and lead to financial ruin, but supporters argue that it is a safe and convenient way to gamble. They point out that online casinos are heavily regulated, and that players can set limits on how much they are willing to spend.

Pennsylvania is now the fourth US state to legalize online gambling (after Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware), and analysts expect other states to follow suit in the coming years.

#  NJ Moves Forward with Online Gambling Regulations

After months of deliberations and consultations, the NJ Division of Gaming Enforcement released proposed rules and regulations for online gambling in the state on November 21, 2018. The new rules would allow casinos in Atlantic City to offer online versions of their games, as well as online sports betting.

The draft regulations were open for public comment until December 21, and the DGE received nearly 150 submissions. The agency has now moved on to the final stages of drafting the regulations, which are expected to be released in early 2019.

There is broad consensus among industry participants that the NJ market is ready for regulated online gambling. However, there are some areas where there is still some disagreement. For example, should casino operators be allowed to offer both poker and casino games? Or should they be limited to one or the other?

There is also debate over what level of tax rate should be applied to online gaming revenues. Some industry insiders argue that a low tax rate could help stimulate growth in the sector, while others say that a higher tax rate would be more equitable.

Regardless of the specifics, it seems likely thatNJ will soon join Nevada and Delaware as states with regulated online gambling. This will provide a much-needed boost to the Atlantic City casino industry, which has been struggling in recent years.

#  Delaware Approves Online Gambling Bill

The state of Delaware has just become the first in the nation to approve a bill that would legalize and regulate online gambling within the borders of the state. The vote was close, but it ultimately passed in favor of the legislation with 11 lawmakers voting in favor and 9 voting against it.

Governor Jack Markell is expected to sign the bill into law, which would then allow residents of Delaware to gamble online at authorized gaming sites. This would include games such as poker, blackjack, roulette, and slots.

The bill’s passage is seen as a major victory for the casino industry, as it would help to offset falling revenue from brick-and-mortar casinos. It is also thought to be a major win for internet gaming companies, who are looking to expand into new markets.

Delaware is not the only state considering legalizing online gambling. New Jersey and Nevada have both recently introduced similar bills, and it is expected that other states will soon follow suit.

#  California Considers Regulating Online Poker

The state of California is currently debating a new bill that would regulate online poker. The purpose of the bill is to help protect consumers and ensure that the games are fair and honest.

As it stands, online poker is currently a legal grey area in California. There are no specific laws that govern the activity, so it is not regulated by the government. This has led to some problems, as there is no way to enforce rules or ensure that players are treated fairly.

The new bill would create a regulatory framework for online poker. This would include licensing requirements for operators, as well as standards for game fairness and consumer protection. The bill would also prohibit certain types of gameplay, such as casino-style games where players can bet on cards.

Supporters of the bill argue that it is necessary to regulate online poker in order to protect consumers. They point out that there have been cases of cheating and fraud in the past, and without regulation, these problems will continue. They also argue that regulating online poker will help to create jobs and generate revenue for the state.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to increased gambling addiction rates and expose children to gambling at a young age. They also say that it is not necessary to regulate online poker, as the games are already safe and honest.

The debate over this bill is ongoing, but it looks likely that it will be passed soon. It will be interesting to see how this new regulatory framework affects the online poker scene in California.

#  New York Could Be Next State to Legalize Online Gambling

The New York Senate and Assembly have both passed a bill legalizing online gambling in the state. The bill now awaits Governor Cuomo’s signature.

Legalizing online gambling could bring in over $200 million in revenue for the state each year. It would also create jobs, with new casinos and other businesses opening up to meet the demand for online gambling services.

 Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to addiction and other problems, but supporters say that those risks can be managed. They also point out that many states have already legalized online gambling, without any major issues arising.

Governor Cuomo is expected to sign the bill into law soon. Once that happens, New Yorkers will be able to start playing casino games, poker, and other types of gambling online.
