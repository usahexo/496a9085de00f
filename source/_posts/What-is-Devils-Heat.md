#  What does Devils Heat mean?

Most NBA fans know about the Devils heat, but don't completely understand what it is. The Devils Heat occurs when a team, typically a lower seed in the playoffs, upsets a higher seed. The higher seed refers to the team that is expected to win, while the lower seed is the underdog. As the underdog, the lower seed often has to play an extra game or two in order to progress to the next round.

The term "Devils Heat" was first coined after the 1974 NBA playoffs. The Milwaukee Bucks, who were a lower seed, managed to upset the Baltimore Bullets, who were a higher seed. The upset became known as the "Devils Heat". This term has been used to describe numerous other playoff upsets over the years.

There are several reasons why a lower seed can upset a higher seed. One reason is simply bad luck on the part of the higher seed. Another reason is that the lower seed may be playing better than expected. Finally, home court advantage can also play a role in deciding an upset.

Despite there being many potential factors involved in an upset, one thing remains constant - passion and determination from the underdog team. These are two essential qualities for any team looking to pull off an epic Devils Heat victory.
