#  Illinois Poker Tables Come with One Deck of Cards and a Bottle of Water

Illinois has been a gambling mecca for years, with casinos dotting the landscape from Chicago to Carbondale. But one form of gambling has been missing from the Land of Lincoln – poker.

That is, until now.

Illinois’ first legal poker room just opened at the Hollywood Casino in Aurora, and players are already raving about the experience. The room features ten tables and offers both Texas Hold’em and Omaha games.

The minimum buy-in is $20, and the house takes a 5% commission on winning hands. The rake is pretty standard for live poker rooms, but what makes this room stand out is the other amenities it offers players.

For starters, each table comes with its own deck of cards and a bottle of water. This may not seem like a big deal, but when you’re playing for hours on end it’s nice to have a fresh deck of cards and some cold water to drink.

The room also features free self-parking and a full buffet with plenty of healthy options. And if you need to take a break from the action, there’s a bar right next to the poker room where you can grab a drink or two.

So far, the reviews for Illinois’ first legal poker room have been overwhelmingly positive. Players are thrilled to finally have a place to play their favorite game in their home state, and the casino has been packed ever since the poker room opened its doors.

#  Illinois Poker Tables are Not Available in Stores

Are you in Illinois and looking for a place to purchase a poker table? You're out of luck. The state has outlawed the sale of all types of poker tables, including those used for gaming purposes.

While there are exceptions for certain antique poker tables, the vast majority of players in Illinois will not be able to buy a new or used table legally. This has caused many residents to look elsewhere for their gaming needs, either by crossing into neighboring states or by buying tables online.

This prohibition on poker tables was put into place back in 2007, when the state passed a law banning all forms of gambling. The only exception is horse racing, which is allowed under the Illinois Racing Board Act. However, even that is limited to just five facilities in the entire state.

Supporters of the ban argue that it is necessary to protect citizens from becoming addicted to gambling. They also claim that it helps to prevent crime and keeps money from flowing out of the state. Critics say that the ban does more harm than good and that it has actually led to an increase in illegal gambling activities.

Whatever your opinion may be, it looks like Illinois poker tables are not going to be available in stores anytime soon. If you want to play cards with your friends, you'll have to go elsewhere.
