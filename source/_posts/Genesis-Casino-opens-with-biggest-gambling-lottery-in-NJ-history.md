#  Genesis Casino opens with biggest gambling lottery in NJ history

The Genesis Casino, the newest gambling establishment to open in Atlantic City, drew crowds on its opening day with a record-breaking $29.5 million lottery. According to NJ regulators, this is the largest gambling lottery in the state's history.

The casino is located at the Atlantic City Boardwalk, directly next to Caesars Palace. It occupies two floors and includes 2,000 slot machines and 125 table games. The casino also offers a variety of restaurants, including Bobby Flay's Bar American and Giada De Laurentiis' Italian Kitchen.

The $29.5 million lottery is just the beginning for Genesis Casino. With its prime location and impressive gaming options, Genesis is set to become one of Atlantic City's most popular casinos.

#  Over $10 million in gambling lottery proceeds generated in opening week

The Connecticut Lottery Corporation announced that it had generated more than $10 million in gambling lottery proceeds in the opening week of sales. This was welcome news to the state government, which stands to gain a significant portion of these proceeds.

The Connecticut Lottery Corporation is a state-run organization that was founded in 1972. It is responsible for the management of several different gambling lottery games, including Powerball, Mega Millions, and Lucky for Life. The corporation has been a major contributor to the state’s budget in recent years, with total profits topping $500 million in 2017.

Much of this revenue comes from ticket sales for the Powerball and Mega Millions games. In both cases, players have the chance to win large jackpots that can reach into the tens of millions of dollars. In fact, the Powerball jackpot reached a record-breaking $1.586 billion in January of 2016.

While it is impossible to predict how well a particular game will do in any given week, it is clear that the Connecticut Lottery Corporation enjoys considerable popularity among gamblers. This popularity is likely due to the large payouts that are available as well as the relative ease of playing the games.

# The state government will use these funds to support a number of important initiatives

The Connecticut Lottery Corporation has long been a key source of funding for the state government. In particular, much of the money raised by the organization goes towards education and transportation initiatives.

For example, a portion of the money generated by lottery ticket sales is used to support financial aid programs at colleges and universities throughout Connecticut. Additionally, some of these funds are put towards improving public transportation systems around the state. By supporting these important initiatives, the Connecticut Lottery Corporation helps to improve life for all residents of Connecticut.

#  Genesis Casino continues to rake in millions from NJ gambling lottery

The Genesis casino in New Jersey has continued to rake in millions of dollars from gambling lottery, despite being in the state for less than a year.

According to statistics from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, the casino took in over $19 million from its gambling lottery games between September and December last year.

This was just slightly below the $21 million it earned in its first six months of operation, from when it launched in late September 2018.

The Genesis casino is one of six such venues operating in the state, and boasts a gaming floor that is more than double the size of any of its competitors. It’s no wonder then that it is quickly becoming a favourite among NJ gamblers.

In addition to its massive gaming floor, the Genesis casino also offers a range of other attractions including restaurants, shopping and a luxury spa. This makes it ideal for those looking for a complete holiday experience.

It’s not just New Jersey residents who are enjoying the Genesis casino though – visitors from other states are also flocking to it in increasing numbers. In fact, recent figures show that around 60% of its customers come from outside of NJ.

This is likely due to the casino’s excellent reputation, which has been built up over many years thanks to its sister venue, the well-known Genesis Casino Resort in Las Vegas.

So if you’re looking for a top-class gambling experience with plenty of other activities on offer too, be sure to check out the Genesis casino in New Jersey. You won’t be disappointed!

#  Gambling lottery at Genesis Casino accounts for nearly one-third of all NJ gaming revenue

In spite of what could be construed as a dismal year for Atlantic City casinos, things are looking up at the state’s online gambling sites. Figures released last month by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement show that online gaming revenue in the state rose by nearly $11 million in 2018, with $332 million generated in total.

The lion’s share of that revenue – some $109.8 million – was generated by casino games offered at Genesis Casino, which offers both slots and table games. That figure accounts for nearly one-third of all NJ online gaming revenue.

In second place was PokerStars NJ, which generated just over $72 million in revenue last year. The Resorts Casino Hotel-owned site is one of the older operators in the Garden State market, having gone live in November 2013.

Other sites contributing to the overall rise in NJ online gaming revenue include Golden NuggetCasino (up 24%), SugarHouse Online Casino (up 34%), and Harrah’s Online Casino (up 43%). Caesars Interactive Entertainment, which operates both Harrah’s and 888casino NJ, saw its online gaming revenue fall by 3% last year.
