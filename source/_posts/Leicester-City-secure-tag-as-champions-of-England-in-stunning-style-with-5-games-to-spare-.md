#  Leicester City secure tag as champions of England in stunning style with 5 games to spare 

After much speculation and anticipation, Leicester City were confirmed as the new champions of England on Monday night, after Tottenham Hotspur could only manage a 2-1 home defeat to Chelsea. The result means that the Foxes - who sit five points clear at the top of the Premier League table with just five games remaining - are now insurmountable favourites to lift the title, and in doing so become the first team ever to win England's top division without having previously won it.

While other teams around them have started to falter in recent weeks, Leicester have displayed impressive consistency and determination, never once letting up in their quest for glory. Manager Claudio Ranieri has been a central figure in their success, masterminding a number of crucial victories while also maintaining an enviable level of squad harmony. Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez have rightfully received much of the credit for spearheading Leicester's attack this season, but there are many other players within the team who have also played a significant role in their title win.

Leicester City fans will now be dreaming of an unprecedented Premier League and UEFA Champions League double, but they will first have to see off competition from fellow English sides Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal in order to reach the final of Europe's elite club competition. Whatever happens from here on out, Leicester City's name is now writ large in the history books as genuine masters of English football.

#  Stats show Leicester City were 5000/1 rank outsiders before title win – but so what? 

In the 2015/16 season, Leicester City were 5000/1 rank outsiders to win the Premier League title before miraculously doing so. This has led to much discussion about how Leicester’s title win disproves the idea of “the bookmakers always know best”.

However, I believe that Leicester’s title win actually provides strong evidence in support of the bookmakers’ wisdom. After all, if we look more closely at the stats, we can see that Leicester were far from genuine contenders prior to their title triumph.

Leicester only won 19 out of 38 games in the Premier League during the 2015/16 season, which meant they only finished in 14th place – barely above the relegation zone. Their goal difference of +14 also showed that they were not particularly strong defensively or offensively.

Meanwhile, Tottenham Hotspur (who finished second) won 26 out of 38 games and had a goal difference of +53. Clearly, Tottenham were a much stronger team than Leicester and were therefore much more likely to win the Premier League title. The 5000/1 odds offered on Leicester City winning the title reflected this fact.

In light of these stats, it is clear that Leicester City’s title win was nothing short of miraculous. They were rank outsiders who only managed to scrape into 14th place in the league table; they were not even close to being good enough to win the Premier League title. So why did they manage to do so?

The answer is simple: because no one expected them to! With such long odds offered on their victory, most people simply wrote them off as irrelevant contenders and didn’t take their challenge seriously. This created a surprise factor which enabled them to beat better teams who were too confident in their own abilities.

This is not to say that Leicester City were not a good team – they clearly were – but rather that they were not good enough to win the Premier League title by conventional means. Their championship success was largely due to luck and circumstance (the lack of expectation from other teams), rather than through any real superiority on their part.

In conclusion, I believe that Leicester City’s title win does not disprove the wisdom of bookmakers, but rather confirms it. The stats show that they were 5000/1 rank outsiders for a reason – they simply weren’t good enough to win the Premier League title on their own merits.

#  How do Leicester City's stats compare to other Premier League winners? 

Leicester City became the surprise Premier League champions in the 2015-16 season. How do their stats compare to other Premier League winners?

In terms of points, Leicester City averaged 1.85 points per game (ppg) during the 2015-16 season. This is the lowest points total of any Premier League champion since the 1992-93 season, when Manchester United averaged 1.83 ppg.

In terms of goals scored, Leicester City averaged 1.42 goals per game (gpg) during the 2015-16 season. This is the lowest average of any Premier League champion since the 1995-96 season, when Manchester United averaged 1.24 gpg.

In terms of goal difference, Leicester City averaged 0.41 goals difference per game (GDPG) during the 2015-16 season. This is the lowest average of any Premier League champion since the 1993-94 season, when Manchester United averaged 0.27 GDPG.

Leicester City’s title success was built on a strong defensive record – they conceded just 32 goals in 38 games, for an average of 0.84 GDPG. No other Premier League champion has ever conceded fewer than 1 goal per game in a 38-game season.

Leicester City’s stats are very comparable to those of other recent Premier League champions – all of whom had much lower points totals than Leicester achieved last season. In fact, their points total would have been enough to finish 5th in both the 2013-14 and 2014-15 seasons, and 3rd in the 2012-13 season.

#  What do the statistics say about Leicester City's chances next season? 

Leicester City's fairy-tale season came to an end earlier this year when they lost out to Tottenham Hotspur in the race for the Premier League title. However, Riyad Mahrez and co. will be determined to go one better next season and mount a serious challenge for the biggest prize in English football.

But what do the statistics say about their chances next season? well according to sports data experts at WhoScored.com, Leicester are 6th favourites to win the Premier League next season, with a 7.5% chance of lifting the trophy. Manchester City (21%), Chelsea (20%), Arsenal (12%), Manchester United (9%) and Liverpool (7%) are all ahead of them in the betting, but anything can happen in the unpredictable world of Premier League football.

Meanwhile, Leicester's odds of winning the Champions League are much longer at 66/1, putting them behind Real Madrid (4/7), Barcelona (11/4), Bayern Munich (3/1) and Juventus (8/1). However, those are still good odds if you fancy your chances of backing Ranieri's side to go all the way in Europe's top club competition.

So overall, it looks like Leicester have a decent chance of winning either the Premier League or Champions League next season - but they'll have to be at their best to topple some of Europe's biggest teams.

#  Could Leicester City's success be down to luck or are they simply the best team in England?

Leicester City have been one of the biggest surprises in world football this season. With only 14 games played, they are currently top of the English Premier League, 5 points clear of their nearest rivals Arsenal. So what has led to their unbelievable success?

Some people believe that Leicester's success is simply down to luck. However, there are a number of reasons why Leicester City are the best team in England at the moment. First of all, they have the joint-best defensive record in the league, having conceded only 14 goals in 14 games. This is largely due to their goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel and their back four of Wes Morgan, Robert Huth, Danny Simpson and Christian Fuchs. Schmeichel has been in excellent form this season and has pulled off some impressive saves, while Morgan, Huth and Simpson have been rock-solid at the back.

Secondly, Leicester also have one of the best midfields in England. N'Golo Kante has been particularly impressive, winning more tackles (97) and making more interceptions (54) than any other player in Europe's top 5 leagues this season. He is joined in midfield by Danny Drinkwater, who has also impressed with his tireless work rate, and Shinji Okazaki, who provides creativity and goals from midfield.

Finally, Leicester's attacking players have also been in good form this season. Jamie Vardy has scored 13 goals in 14 games so far this season, Riyad Mahrez has 11 goals and 5 assists, and Okazaki has 7 goals himself. These players have been scoring goals for fun this season and have been a real thorn in the side of opposition defences.

So overall, it is clear that Leicester City are not simply a team who have been lucky this season. They are currently the best team in England and deserve to be at the top of the table
